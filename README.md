# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of cardiovascular disease based on patient health data. The goal is to identify key risk factors and develop a predictive model for early diagnosis.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Machine learning model development and evaluation
- Model interpretability and visualization

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes medical parameters such as:

- **Age**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Cholesterol Levels**
- **Heart Rate**
- **Lifestyle Factors**

## 📊 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost

## 🔥 Results

The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC score. The best model provides reliable predictions for cardiovascular disease risk.
